Handwritten Digit Recognizer Model - README

Overview

This project is a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a labeled dataset of digit images and predicts the digit (0-9) from unseen handwritten images. This project utilizes standard machine learning techniques, such as data preprocessing and feature extraction, and leverages Keras/TensorFlow for model implementation.

The repository includes:

Training and test datasets.

Model architecture code.

Trained model weights.

Sample submission for Kaggle.

File Structure

train.csv: The training dataset with labeled handwritten digit images.

test.csv: The test dataset containing unlabeled handwritten digit images for prediction.

sample_submission.csv: Sample submission file for Kaggle competitions, containing example predictions.

02-Model.py: Python script that defines and trains the Convolutional Neural Network for digit recognition.

results.weights.h5: Trained model weights that can be loaded for predictions.

LouisBonvarlet_CNN_DigitRecogniser.csv: The output predictions from the model on the test dataset in CSV format, ready for submission.

Model Overview

Architecture

The model employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. The key components are:

Input Layer: Takes 28x28 pixel images as input.

Convolutional Layers: Extracts spatial features from the image using kernels.

Max-Pooling Layers: Downsamples the feature maps to reduce dimensionality and prevent overfitting.

Fully Connected Layers (Dense Layers): Interprets the extracted features for classification.

Output Layer: A softmax layer that outputs the predicted probability distribution for each digit (0-9).

Training Process

Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy.

Optimizer: Adam optimizer for adaptive learning rate.

Metrics: Accuracy is used to evaluate model performance.

Batch Size: Defined in the code as part of training.

Epochs: The model trains for several iterations (epochs) over the training data to optimize weights.

Data Preprocessing

The images are scaled down to values between 0 and 1 by dividing pixel values by 255.

The training labels are one-hot encoded for classification purposes.

Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation and zoom, may be employed to improve model generalization.

Usage

Requirements

To run the project, the following libraries are required:

Python 3.x

TensorFlow or Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib (for visualizations)

Install the required packages using:

bash

Copy code

pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib

Training the Model

To train the model from scratch, run the 02-Model.py script:

bash

Copy code

python 02-Model.py

This will load the training data from train.csv, preprocess the images, build the CNN, and train the model. The trained weights will be saved as results.weights.h5.

Making Predictions

To make predictions on new data (i.e., the test dataset), use the trained model weights in results.weights.h5 by running the script:

bash

Copy code
python 02-Model.py --predict

This will load the test data from test.csv, preprocess the images, and output predictions in LouisBonvarlet_CNN_DigitRecogniser.csv.

Evaluation

The model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a validation set. In this project, we use the accuracy metric on the test set.

Submission

For Kaggle competitions or similar, predictions are saved in the CSV file LouisBonvarlet_CNN_DigitRecogniser.csv in the required format:

ImageId: Index of the image in the test set.

Label: The predicted digit for each image.

To submit the predictions, simply upload the CSV file on the respective competition page.

Future Work

Some possible areas for improvement include:

Experimenting with deeper architectures or transfer learning.

Using advanced data augmentation techniques to further improve accuracy.
Hyperparameter tuning for better optimization.
